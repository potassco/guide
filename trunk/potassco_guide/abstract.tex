\begin{abstract}
This document provides an introduction to the Answer Set Programming (ASP) tools
\gringo, \clasp, and \clingo, developed at the University of Potsdam.
The first tool, \gringo, is a \emph{grounder} capable of translating
logic programs provided by users into equivalent propositional logic programs.
The answer sets of such programs are computed by \clasp,
which is a \emph{solver} processing the output of \gringo.
The third tool, \clingo, combines the functionalities of \gringo\ and \clasp,
and additionally integrates the scripting languages \lua\ and \python\ either
through libraries or embedded code.
This guide, for one, aims at enabling ASP novices
to make use of the aforementioned tools.
For another, it provides a reference of the tools' features
that ASP adepts might be tempted to exploit.
