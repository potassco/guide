\section{Constraint Programming}\label{sec:constraint}

This section is not yet ready for publishing
and will be included in one of the forthcoming editions of this guide.

Information on constraint programming with \gringo\ (and \clingcon) can be obtained at the following references.

\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{geossc09a,ostsch12a} (\clingcon, based upon \gringo~3.0.92 and \clasp~1.3.10)
\item Video on \gringo~4's constraint solving capacities \url{http://youtu.be/QrP8KiDl3hw} (see also \url{http://potassco.sourceforge.net/videos.html})
\item Constraint programming in ASP via \aspartame\ \cite{bageinscsotawe13a}; see also \url{http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/aspartame}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\gringo's constraint solving capacities}

\gringo\ features some experimental means for expressing finite linear constraint satisfaction problems within ASP's modeling language and
for subsequently solving them with off-the-shelf ASP solvers such as \clasp.
%
To this end,
all constraint relations and constraint variables are (currently) preceded by a dollar symbol, \texttt{\$}.
In addition, there is a global constraint
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{\#disjoint\{ term : value \}}
\end{itemize}
The idea is that sets of values labeled with the same term(s) must be disjoint.

The overall compilation follows the order encoding \cite{tatakiba09a} and
introduces a Boolean variable for each statement `$X\leq k$' where $X$ is a variable over integers and $k$ is an integer bound.

As an example,
consider the following encoding of the $n$-queens puzzle.
\marginlabel{To compute both answer sets, invoke:\\
  \code{\mbox{~}clingo \attach{examples/queensC.lp}{queensC.lp} \textbackslash\\
         \mbox{~} -c n=300}\\
  or alternatively:\\
  \code{\mbox{~}gringo~\attach{examples/queensC.lp}{queensC.lp} \textbackslash\\
        \mbox{~} -c n=300 | clasp 0}
}
\lstinputlisting{examples/queensC.lp}
