\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

We conclude this guide with a brief outlook on the future development
of \gringo, \clasp, \clingo, and \iclingo.
An important goal of future releases will be improving usability
by adding functionalities that make some errors and warnings obsolete or,
otherwise, by providing helpful context information along with the remaining ones.
In particular, we consider adding support for yet missing traditional
features in incremental computations of \iclingo\
and also the integration of \clasp\ and \claspD~\cite{drgegrkakoossc08a},
which would enable \clasp, \clingo, and \iclingo\ to deal with disjunctive programs
(cf.~\cite{eitgot95a}) or, more generally, logic programs such that standard reasoning tasks
are complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (cf.~\cite{papadimitriou94a}).
Moreover, we are investigating less demanding restrictedness notions
that can broaden the class of
acceptable input programs.
For the representation of ground programs,
\emph{ASPils} format~\cite{gejaosscth08a} has been suggested to overcome
limitations of \lparse's output format~\cite{lparseManual},
and we work on \emph{ASPils} support in \clasp.
In the long term,
limitations inherent to present ASP systems,
such as space explosion sometimes faced when representing
multi-valued variables in a propositional formalism,
might be extinguished by systems combining ASP with
neighboring paradigms like, e.g., Constraint Programming~\cite{robewa06a}.
Prototypical approaches in such directions already exist
today~\cite{melgel08a,niolti06a}.
